# Recommerder system - Netflix Dataset

In this NoteBook, I will use the Netflix dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/netflix-inc/netflix-prize-data) to create a recommender system. The goal of this project is to provide the top k movies for a specific user.

We will use a method called Collaborative Filtering which, in simple word, use the ratings of similar users to predict the rating of a user. More especially, we will use the SVD (Single Value Decomposition) algorithm because it's an efficient one and it's still used a lot.
